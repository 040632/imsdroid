=SIP Configuration=

Before starting to use the client you should configure your identity and the network settings. This short guide explain how to do this.

== Identity ==
At the home screen, go to *Options->Identity* to open the *Identity screen*.<br />

[http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/screen_identity.png http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/screenshots/screen_identity.png]

*Display Name:* Your nickname. Useless in this beta version.<br />

*IMS Public Identity (IMPU):* As its name says, itâ€™s your public visible identifier where you are willing to receive calls or any demands. An IMPU could be either a SIP or tel URI (e.g. tel:+33100000 or sip:bob@open-ims.test).<br />
For those using IMSDroid as a basic SIP client, the IMPU should coincide with their SIP URI (a.k.a SIP address).<br />

*IMS Private Identity (IMPI):* The IMPI is a unique identifier assigned to a user (or UE) by the home network. It could be either a SIP URI (e.g. sip:bob@open-ims.test), a tel URI (e.g. tel:+33100000) or any alphanumeric string (e.g. bob@open-ims.test or bob). <br />
For those using IMSDroid as a basic SIP client, the IMPI should coincide with their authentication name. If you don't know what is your IMPI, then fill the field with your SIP address as above.<br />

*Password:* Your password.<br />

*Realm:* The realm is the name of the domain to authenticate to. It should be a valid SIP URI (e.g. sip:open-ims.test). <br />

*3GPP Early IMS Security:* If you are not using an IMS server you should use this option to disable some heavy IMS authentication procedures.<br />

== Network Settings ==
At the home screen, go to *Options->Network* to open the *Network screen*. <br />

*IP version:* In this beta version only IPv4 is supported.<br />

*Proxy-CSCF Host:* This is the IP address or FQDN (Fully-Qualified Domain Name) of your SIP server or outbound proxy (e.g. 88.89.125.125 or example.com). <br />

*Proxy-CSCF Port:* The port associated to the proxy host. Should be *5060*.<br />

*Transport:* The transport type (TCP or UDP) to use.<br />

*Proxy-CSCF Discovery:* Should be None. <br />

*Enable SigComp:* Will enable Signaling Compression. Only check if your server support this feature. Should not be checked. <br />

== Connecting ==
Return to the home screen and click on *Sign In* item to connect to your SIP server. <br />
If the connection succeed, you will have new items in the home screen (see below) and a green notification icon will be added in the status bar. <br />

=Voice/Video Call=
This beta version (v1.0.0) already supports both audio and video calls.
* Supported Audio Codecs: AMR-NB, GSM, PCMA, PCMU, Speex-NB <br />
* Supported Video codecs: H264, Theora, H.263, H.263-1998, H.261 <br />

==Codecs==
To choose which audio/video codecs to enable/disable you should go to *Options->Codecs* screen page as shown below. <br />

==Audio/Video call==
You can place a call from the dialer, address book or the history screen. <br />
===Dialer===
The dialer is accessible from the home screen ([http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/imsdroid/res/drawable/dialer_48.png http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/imsdroid/res/drawable/dialer_48.png]). <br /> The dialer screen is shown below. <br />
You can enter any phone number (e.g. '+33100000000' or '0600000000'), SIP URI (e.g. 'sip:bob@open-ims.test'). If the SIP Uri is incomplete (e.g. 'bob') the application will automatically append the scheme ('sip:') and domain name('@open-ims.test') before placing the call. <br />
