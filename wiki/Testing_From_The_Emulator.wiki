==Network Option==
If you try to run IMSDroid on the emulator it will alert that there is *"No active net work"*. The problem comes from the emulator which always believes that you are using 3G/2.5 networks. Off course you are not (and cannot from the emulator). <br />
This means that you should give your permission to use 3G/2.5 networks. From the home screen, click on the Options item([http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/imsdroid/res/drawable/options_48.png]) then Network ([http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/imsdroid/res/drawable/network_48.png]) and check "Enable 3G/2.G networks". <br />

==Receiving Requests==
On some emulators, such as Google Android (10.2.0.15) or Windows mobile, the IP address and port on which we bound to is not routable. This IP address and port is used in the “Contact” header to form our AoR. All incoming requests will be sent from the server to this IP address. <br /> To hack the AoR in order to use a routable IP address you should, from the home screen, click  on the Options item([http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/imsdroid/res/drawable/options_48.png]) then Network ([http://imsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/imsdroid/res/drawable/network_48.png]) and check "Hack the AoR". <br />
Your server MUST support *rport*.<br />
